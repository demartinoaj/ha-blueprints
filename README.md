Collection of Home Assistant Blueprints I've created

## Pseudo Light Switch
  Virtually link A Zigbee2MQTT Switch to a Light entity, only using button press events to control the light.

The purpose of this blueprint is esentialy provide a "smart bulb mode" for Z2M connected zigbee switches that don't support it natively. I wanted to bind my wifi smart bulbs to my zigbee switches, but I found that my [Enbrighten](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/devices/43076.html) switches didn't properly report brightness in Home Assistant without a real load attached. So I couldn't just have the switch enitiy shadow the light enitity. I got around this by using the switch event sensor generated by Z2M and mapping the type of button press to my desired behavior. In my experince shadowing light entities in home assistant has been glitchy, so this solution has a bonus of being a lot more stable as well.

My switches only supported on/off and brightness_move_up/down events, so double tap events will not register in this blueprint.
